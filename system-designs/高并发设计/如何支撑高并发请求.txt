1150 requests per second 每秒需要处理的请求/系统必须支撑的并发量

TODO. Scaling up machine 单机/单体架构
What kind of load can be handled by a single machine ?
  - Concurrency threads per machine 机器能够并发处理的线程数量
What is load that definitely needs more computing power
  - Is there some CPU-intensive computations ? 是否存在CPU密集型的任务

提高单体机器性能的缺陷:
After a given point the hardware isn’t capable of handling all the requests
If you only have one machine, and it goes down your whole application is down


TODO. Scaling out machine 集群架构
Spreads the computations over a number of machines and distributes the load across them
Use load balancer to handle initial traffic
Use load balancer to send requests to a set of servers running one or more instances of APP

扩展机器集群的优点:
避免一台机器中断整个服务
机器中的一台机器可以运行多个APP实例
