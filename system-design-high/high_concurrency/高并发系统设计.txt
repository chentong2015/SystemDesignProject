TODO. Scaling up machine 单机/单体架构
What kind of load can be handled by a single machine ?
  - Concurrency threads per machine
What is load that definitely needs more computing power ?
  - Is there some CPU-intensive computations

After a given point the hardware isn’t capable of handling all the requests
If you only have one machine, and it goes down your whole application is down

TODO. Scaling out machine 集群架构: 避免单点挂断 + 保证多实例部署
Spreads the computations over a number of machines and distributes the load across them
Use load balancer to handle initial traffic
Use load balancer to send requests to a set of servers running one or more instances of APP
